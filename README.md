# todo-list

In this project, I implemented a simple task-manager. To start this project locally you need write some simple commands:

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py migrate

Paste your SECRET_KEY (that`s your djando secret key to run project ) into .env.sample file to load secret information 

See the .env.sample file for an example and create your .env file

python manage.py runserver

If you want to create more data just login by this superuser data : username : sofia password: sofia4455
