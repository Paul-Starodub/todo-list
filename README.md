# todo-list

In this project, I implemented a simple task-manager. To start this project locally you need write some simple commands:

python3 -m venv env
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
Paste your SECRET_KEY (that`s your djando secret key to run project ) into .env.sample file to load secret information from AND RENAME FILE TO .env !
python manage.py runserver
If you want to create more data just login by this superuser data : username : sofia password: sofia4455
